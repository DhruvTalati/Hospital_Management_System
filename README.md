# Hospital Patient Management System

This is my **Hospital Patient Management System** project developed using **Python**, **Tkinter**, and **MySQL (via XAMPP)**.  
It helps manage **patients, doctors, and appointments** efficiently through a **user-friendly GUI**, while using **OOP, file handling, regex validation, and exception handling** for robust data management.

---

## Features
- Add, update, and view doctor details.  
- Register and manage patient records with full history in MySQL.  
- Book, update, and cancel appointments via Tkinter GUI.  
- Validate emails and mobile numbers using Regex.  
- Handle invalid inputs or dates with proper exception handling.  
- Generate and save patient reports using file handling.

---

## Concepts Used
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Classes for Patient, Doctor, and Appointment.  
- **File Handling:** Create and store reports.  
- **Regex Validation:** Ensure correct email and phone formats.  
- **Exception Handling:** Manage invalid inputs safely.  
- **MySQL Database (via XAMPP):** Store and retrieve patient and appointment data.  
- **Tkinter GUI:** Provides an interactive interface for users.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **GUI Framework:** Tkinter  
- **Database:** MySQL (via XAMPP)  
- **Libraries:** `tkinter`, `mysql.connector`, `re`, `datetime`, `os`, `csv`

## How to Run
1. Start **Apache** and **MySQL** in **XAMPP Control Panel**.  
2. Create a database (e.g., `hospital_db`) in **phpMyAdmin** and import the provided `.sql` file.  
3. Install Python dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install mysql-connector-python
4.Run the project:
bash
python main.py
5.Use the Tkinter GUI to manage doctors, patients, and appointments.

## Future Enhancements
-Email/SMS notifications for appointments.
-Billing and invoice generation module.
-Role-based login system (Admin, Doctor, Receptionist).
-Analytics dashboard for hospital data.
-Cloud-based database integration.

## About

I built this project to practice Python OOP, GUI development, and database integration in a real-world scenario. It demonstrates how a Tkinter GUI can work with MySQL to create a complete hospital management system.tice Python OOP, GUI development, and database integration in a real-world scenario.
